# Pain Monitoring Task

This continuous pain rating task assesses pain intensity using the open-source software PsychoPy [1] hosted on Pavlovia [2]. At the start, participants were provided with detailed instructions and required to complete a short practice run to ensure they understood how the application worked. Once this was completed, participants continuously rated their pain for approximately five minutes on a vertical scale ranging from "Least Pain" to "Most Pain."

The interface of the application and the experiment timeline are depicted in Figure 1:
