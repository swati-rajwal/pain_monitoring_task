This continuous pain rating task assesses pain intensity using the open-source software PsychoPy [1] hosted on Pavlovia [2]. At the start, participants are provided with detailed instructions and asked to complete a short practice run to ensure they understood how the application worked. Once this is completed, participants continuously rated their pain for approximately five minutes on a vertical scale ranging from "Least Pain" to "Most Pain."

The interface of the application and the experiment timeline are depicted in Figure 1:

## 🎯Application
This task helped us collect pain ratings and highlight the importance of short-term variability in chronic musculoskeletal pain and its potential as a predictor of clinical outcomes. Please read our paper as cited below for more details.
